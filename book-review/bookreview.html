Guides and evolves us to get out of the loop of unwanted thinking and throws light on how one can live life happily which is the most natural and ideal way of living! I have started reading books recently and couldn't resist completing this one!</p>

    <h2>3. THE SILENT PATIENT </h2>
    <img src="3.jpg" height="200px" width="100px">
    <p>I bought this book after much persuasion by my friend, although there are some obscenities in the book, but the book was gripping and kept me addicted to the last page, and God! The twist in the last chapter left me speechless. The in-depth writing, expressing the emotions of characters, is very rare to find in books of mystery genre since they mainly focus on the plot, but this is where the book is extraordinary, loved reading the emotional turmoil and the writer's own theses about the human-psych.
        Highly recommended for crime enthusiasts!</p>
    <h2>4. That Night: Four Friends, Twenty Years</h2>

    <h2>5. The Alchemist</h2>
    <img src="5.jpg" height="200px" width="100px">
    <p>A very beautiful journey is described. This book kept me engaged in reading. Loved it.</p>
    <h2>6. Kunex It Ends With Us : ''Sometimes The One Who Loves You Is The One Who Hurts You The Most''</h2>
    <img src="6.jpg" height="200px" width="100px">
    <p>Beautifully carved out tale. People can relate to the story because it does happen and you do find yourself at crossroads. Sometimes you give in sometimes you don't but the guilt when you don't is very hard to not believe in. Hope is what people feed on throughout the journey and that is exactly what this story offers. Hope, courage and love for humans and their humane emotions. Must read!!</p>
    <h2>7. A Man Called Ove</h2>
    <img src="7.jpg" height="200px" width="100px">
    <p>This is an amazing book that perfectly captures life in all its highs and lows. It made me laugh out loud at times and cry at others. At no point does it leave you untouched. Be ware to grab a box of tissues as you near the end. Left me sobbing but so life-affirming. Don’t hesitate to read this</p>
    <h2>8.The Complete Novels of Sherlock Holmes</h2>
    
    <img src="8.jpg" height="200px" width="100px">
    <p>The book is thrilling but the thing is i found it monotonous maybe because of its small print. I have watched several moviea of Sherlock Holmes and I thought maybe it will provide me with the exact same thrill but I read onlg half of it and it is sitting on my shelf to complete it. I feel lazy and bored reading it.

        If you are thinking of purchasing it have an absolute motivation to complete it or it will end on your shelf as well.</p>
    <h2>9. Ghosts of The Silent Hills: Stories based on true hauntings</h2>
    <img src="9.jpg" height="200px" width="100px">
    <p>This book is awesome! It's filled with different stories that are so interesting to read. It gives a sense of nostalgia for some reason, a feeling you can’t describe. Maybe because it’s my home country. Nevertheless, if you're into horror stuff, you'll love it! Definitely give it a go!</p>
    <h2>10. The Good Girl's Guide to Murder</h2>
    <img src="10.jpg" height="200px" width="100px">
    <p>The book was really great. I loved Pippa's determination on finding the true killer. The book had awesome plot twist which had been completely unexpected. Overall a great book.</p>
